```

## Language

Choose the language of the user interface. It defaults to the system language when set to *Default*. Thirty localizations are included.

## Hidden Configuration Options

There are some settings which aren't yet available in the *Preferences* either because they are not considered stable yet or not of general interest. Follow these steps to enable a hidden preference referenced in the wiki:

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} macOS

Type the `defaults` command given in a *Terminal.app* (in `/Applications/Utilities`) window and restart Cyberduck.

    defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/ch.sudo.cyberduck.plist <property> <value>

Alternatively you can create a file `default.properties` in the [application support folder](faq.md#preferences-and-application-support-files-location). Add the setting as follows:

`...`<br/>
`<property>=<value>`<br/>
`...`

````
````{group-tab} Windows

If not existing yet you need to create the file [%AppData%](faq.md#preferences-and-application-support-files-location)`\Cyberduck\default.properties`. To do that create a new text file within `%AppData%\Cyberduck` and replace the preconfigured name including the file extension by *default.properties*.

Add the setting as follows:

`...`<br/>
`<property>=<value>`<br/>
`...`
````
````{group-tab} CLI
